(Project was done in a group of 3 and lasted from February-April 2024, where I worked on implementing the Minimax agent along with helping to integrate the Pacman game UI)

The project focuses on implementing 3 kinds of AI agents in playing the game Pacman: A*, Alpha-Beta, and Minimax as a way of representing their
respective algorithms, and it compares the performance of those agents with completing several games of Pacman to the performance of an average
human player.
